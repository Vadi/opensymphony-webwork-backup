Mapping file for the Bid class of CaveatEmptor.

This class represents a single Bid for a particular Item. The mapping
uses the MonetaryAmount and a UserType mapping to represent the
monetary value of a bid, with a separate column for currency.

The relationship to the item is bidirectional and the outer join
setting is "true", so loading a Bid will fetch the associated
Item in the same select.

The same is true for the association to the User who made the bid,
we usually need both the item and the bidder together with the bid.

Both the reference to Item and User are never updated, this is also
true for all other properties of the Bid. A Bid is immutable. We also
use a custom PropertyAccessor to avoid unused setter methods (the
custom accessor only uses getter methods and sets fields directly).
