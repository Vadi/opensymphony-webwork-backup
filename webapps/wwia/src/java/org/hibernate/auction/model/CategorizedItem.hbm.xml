Mapping file for the CategorizedItem class of CaveatEmptor.

This is really a very special mapping. The CategorizedItem class
represents an association table. The ER model for this is really
a many-to-many association, but instead of two entities and two
collections, we mapped this as two one-to-many associations between
three entities. One of the motivation for this are the additional
attributes on the association table (not only two FKs): username
and creation date.

This class is the entity in the middle, between Category and Item.
You can see that it has references to both. The trick is the usage
of update="false" insert="false" on the <many-to-one> mapping
elements. The foreign/primary key columns of the association table
is therefore managed by the <key-property> mappings in the composite
key.

Note that the composite key is encapsulated in an inner class, which
simplifies the implementation of equals/hashCode. We recommend to
always use a separate composite key class.
