    QuickStart can be used to extend other QuickStart configurations.

    extend upon a base webapp or evven just a base set of classes.

    QuickStart supports reading your IDEA module configuration and
    using the libraries there. This is especially useful for maven
    users who don't have a single directory in their project that
    contains all the libraries they need.
