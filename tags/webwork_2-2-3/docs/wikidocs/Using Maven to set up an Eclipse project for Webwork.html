				    <p>Because WebWork is under active development, these instructions are likely to be out-of-date in specifics.&nbsp; Hopefully the basic strategies will still apply.</p>

<p>First, if xwork is not available from a Maven repo (for example, if it has moved to a SNAPSHOT dependency), then check it out from the CVS repository and run "mvn install" - this gives you the snapshot of XWork as well as the POM for resolving transitive dependencies like oscore.&nbsp; This may apply to other dependencies which are not on ibiblio, but when I first tried this, xwork was the one with enough transitive dependencies to be hard to manage any other way.</p>

<p>For other dependencies which are not on ibiblio, from the webwork CVS checkout (sandbox), run "ant common.jar".  This will cause Ivy to fetch the other dependencies you need.</p>

<p>Then, for each of the missing dependencies, install using "mvn install:install-file"  Below are examples, but of course the path to your ".ivy-cache" directory will differ, and the versions are likely to change for lots of reason, but especially if the dependency is a SNAPSHOT with a timestamp in the filename.</p>

<p>If you, like me, are not running Java 5.0, then you will also need to install the dom3 APIs.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, the compiled JAR is not on any Maven repository. the source for dom3 can be found here: <a href="http://ibiblio.org/maven2/xerces/dom3-xml-apis/1.0/dom3-xml-apis-1.0-sources.jar&amp;nbsp" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttp://ibiblio.org/maven2/xerces/dom3-xml-apis/1.0/dom3-xml-apis-1.0-sources.jar&amp;nbsp</a>; You can build a jar from it and then put it in your own repository.&nbsp; After that, I had to edit webwork's pom.xml to point to the dependency &#45;&#45; webwork has a comment in the &lt;profiles&gt; section acknowledging the need for this, but presumably it will not be changed until dom3 gets officially loaded as a compiled JAR to some maven repository.&nbsp; I believe there should be a way to use Maven2's <em>settings.xml</em> file to do this locally without editing pom.xml, but I have not had a chance to investigate this yet.</p>


<p>These steps worked for me a week or so ago; the pom has changed since then and I haven't yet had time to rebuild, but this kind of approach should work.&nbsp; </p>
