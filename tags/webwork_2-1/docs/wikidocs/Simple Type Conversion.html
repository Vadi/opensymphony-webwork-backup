				    <p class="paragraph">Type Conversion is great for situations where you need to get turn a String in to a more complex object. Because the web is type-agnostic (everything is String in HTTP), WebWork&#039;s type conversion features are very useful. For instance, if you were prompting a user to enter in coordinates in the form a String (&quot;3, 22&quot;), you could have WebWork do the conversion both for String <del class="deleted">&gt; Point and Point</del>&gt;String.</p>Using this &quot;poinrt&quot; example, if your action (or another compound object in which you are setting properties on) has a cooresponding ClassName-conversion.properties file, WebWork will use the configured type converters for conversion to and from strings. So turning &quot;3, 22&quot; in to new Point(3, 22) is done by merely adding the following entry to ClassName-conversion.properties:

<div class="code"><pre>point = com.acme.PointConverter&#10;# note&#58; PointerConverter must implement ognl.TypeConverter &#10;#          or extend ognl.DefaultTypeConverter</pre></div><p class="paragraph">Your type converter should be sure to check what class type it is being requested to convert. Because it is used for both to and from strings, you will need to split the conversion method in to two parts: one that turns Strings in to Points, and one that turns Points in to Strings.</p>After this is done, you can now reference your point (&lt;ww:property value=&quot;point&quot;/&gt;) and it will be printed as &quot;3, 22&quot; again. As such, if you submit this back to an action, it will be converted back to a Point once again.<p class="paragraph">NOTE: Type conversion should not be used as a substitute for i18n. It is not recommended to use this feature to print out properly formatted dates. Rather, you should use the i18n features of WebWork (and consult the JavaDocs for JDK&#039;s MessageFormat object) to see how a properly formatted date should be displayed.</p>
