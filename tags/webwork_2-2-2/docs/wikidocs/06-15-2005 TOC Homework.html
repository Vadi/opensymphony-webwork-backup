<p><em>The questions included in the FAQ should be extracted from the User Forum/Mailing List. Someone could review recent messages and find out which questions are asked the most. After that, separate the questions into categories to form the subsections.</em></p>

<h3><a name="06-15-2005TOCHomework-Tutorial"></a>Tutorial</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Downloading and installing WebWork</li>
	<li>Setting up the test environment (to test tutorial source code)</li>

	<li>Understanding actions</li>
	<li>Understanding results</li>
	<li>Meet WebWork tag library <em>(would also explain a little bit of OGNL)</em></li>

<p><em>This should be in conformance to Patrick's example app. Vitor will talk to Patrick to get his opinions on the sequence of lessons suggested above and how to make the tutorial conformant to the example app.</em></p>

	<li>Tips and tricks on Application Servers <em>(this was in "Overview")</em></li>
	<li>Stuff from the current <a href="Cookbook.html" title="Cookbook">Cookbook</a>...</li>
</ul>


<p><em>All the tips in the <a href="Cookbook.html" title="Cookbook">Cookbook</a> should be revised. Some of them could belong to the tutorial instead (basic stuff). 3rd party integration tips could be separated from the rest. Also, it would be good if all of them also followed the same structure, kind of like a tutorial lesson, but on advanced topics. The differences between the Tutorial and the Cookbook would be:</em></p>

<p><em>A question that arised in the TOC discussion was: what's the difference between the Cookbook and the FAQ? Well, some of the items in the Cookbook are also FAQs (people ask about them a lot), so they would also be included in the FAQ, with links to the Cookbook. The FAQ should have quick answers or link to longer answers, such as the Cookbook. The Cookbook is tutorial-style, a collection of mini HOW-TOs.</em></p>

<p><em>An important thing about the reference is that it should be written in book-style (or hibernate-reference-style) so a PDF version would be generated and people could print it, pass it around the office or read it while working out or relaxing in bed. <img class="emoticon" src="./icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> Therefore, Confluence's PDF features play a big part in this. Some questions that came up during the discussions:</em></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>The reference could link to other pages in some situations. Links in confluence do not reference URLs, but the page's names. Does Confluence convert them to the URL before writing the PDF? If not, should the Reference not link to any pages outside it?</em></li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li><em>Can we select which pages are converted into PDF? If we want to convert only the Reference to PDF, can we do that? How does that work?</em></li>
</ul>
