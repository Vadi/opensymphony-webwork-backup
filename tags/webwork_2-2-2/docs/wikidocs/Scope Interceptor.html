<p> This is designed to solve a few simple issues related to wizard-like functionality in WebWork. One of those issues is
 that some applications have a application-wide parameters commonly used, such <i>pageLen</i> (used for records per
 page). Rather than requiring that each action check if such parameters are supplied, this interceptor can look for
 specified parameters and pull them out of the session.</p>

<p> <p/> This works by setting listed properties at action start with values from session/application attributes keyed
 after the action's class, the action's name, or any supplied key. After action is executed all the listed properties
 are taken back and put in session or application context.</p>

<p> <p/> To make sure that each execution of the action is consistent it makes use of session-level locking. This way it
 guarantees that each action execution is atomic at the session level. It doesn't guarantee application level
 consistency however there has yet to be enough reasons to do so. Application level consistency would also be a big
 performance overkill.</p>

<p> <p/> Note that this interceptor takes a snapshot of action properties just before result is presented (using a {@link
 PreResultListener}), rather than after action is invoked. There is a reason for that: At this moment we know that
 action's state is "complete" as it's values may depend on the rest of the stack and specifically - on the values of
 nested interceptors.</p>


<h1><a name="ScopeInterceptor-Parameters"></a>Parameters</h1>


<p> <ul></p>

<p> <li>session - a list of action properties to be bound to session scope</li></p>

<p> <li>application - a list of action properties to be bound to application scope</li></p>

<p> <li>key - a session/application attribute key prefix, can contain following values:</li></p>

<p> <ul></p>

<p> <li>CLASS - that creates a unique key prefix based on action namespace and action class, it's a default value</li></p>

<p> <li>ACTION - creates a unique key prefix based on action namespace and action name</li></p>

<p> <li>any other value is taken literally as key prefix</li></p>

<p> </ul></p>

<p> <li>type - with one of the following</li></p>

<p> <ul></p>

<p> <li>start - means it's a start action of the wizard-like action sequence and all session scoped properties are reset
 to their defaults</li></p>

<p> <li>end - means that session scoped properties are removed from session after action is run</li></p>

<p> <li>any other value or no value means that it's in-the-middle action that is set with session properties before it's
 executed, and it's properties are put back to session after execution</li></p>

<p> </ul></p>

<p> <li>sessionReset - boolean value causing all session values to be reset to action's default values or application
 scope values, note that it is similliar to type="start" and in fact it does the same, but in our team it is sometimes
 semantically preferred. We use session scope in two patterns - sometimes there are wizzard-like action sequences that
 have start and end, and sometimes we just want simply reset current session values.</li></p>

<p> </ul></p>
