<h1><a name="top">WebWork2.2  Portlet Support Demo</a></h1>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>WebWork2.2 now support JSR168 Portlet natively.(WebWork Portlet function name short as: WWPortlet). Using WWPortlet can minimize the
difficulty of Portlet Development. During the Portlet development early
stage, you even can use normal Web Container such as Tomcat, WAS as
testing environment to develop portal application, and last deploy in
the JetSpeed/Tomcat or WebSphere Portal Server v5.1.</P>
<P>Using WWPortlet to develop Portal Application, you do not need to
know any API &amp; concept of Portlet &amp; JSR168, you can develop your
Portal Application just as traditional WebWork/Velocity application.</P>
<H3>Why you need this MVC Portlet Framework?</H3>
<P>Recently more &amp; more developers are interesting in Portal
Development, but JSR168 API is difficult to learn to develop big reality
application. Also JSR168 API is different from traditional Servlet API,
every client post request is seperated to two steps to run:
processAction, (doView|doHelp|doEdit). Such development model is
nightmare for newbie.</P>
<P>Now more open source fans are familiar in WebWork, Spring, Hibernate,
Velocity etc. framework, and used those framework in their production
successfully.</P>
<P class="infomark">Can we continue to use those skills in developing
Portal application?</P>
<P class="infomark">Can we develop Portal application just as
traditional J2EE application?</P>
<P class="donemark">The answer is yes, we do that. This is the right
place to answer your those questions. You can use WWPortlet MVC
Framework to develop portlet just like legacy WebWork/Velocity
application, you can test your application in Tomcat/WebSphere, even in
JSE, which WebWork provide such advantage. Then last deploy tested
application in JetSpeed/WebSphere Portal Server as standard JSR168
Portlet Application.</P>
