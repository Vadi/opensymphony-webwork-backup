				    <p>WebWork provides a quick way to get started called QuickStart. QuickStart is essentially a combination of a few technologies and some general conventions for developing web applications. What it lets you do is write applications without the need to even compile your sources, let alone have to deploy and redeploy them after every change. Instead, you can now develop your web applications just like if you were writing perl or PHP &#8211; on the fly and as quickly as you can think.</p>

<h1><a name="QuickStart-HowtoUseIt">How to Use It</a></h1>

<p>QuickStart is included in the WebWork distribution and can be launched by simply running <b>java -jar webwork.jar quickstart:mywebapp</b>. At this point you can access <a href="http://localhost:8080/mywebapp" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttp://localhost:8080/mywebapp</a> and begin developing your application. <b>At this time, QuickStart requires Java 1.5</b>.</p>

<p>OK, it's a little more work than that, but not much more. QuickStart assumes the following directory structure:</p>

<ul>
	<li>webwork
	<ul>
		<li>lib - all your required libs, usually the ones you would put in WEB-INF/lib</li>
		<li>webapps
		<ul>
			<li>mywebapp
			<ul>
				<li>src
				<ul>
					<li>java - your java sources that would normally be compiled to WEB-INF/classes</li>
					<li>webapp
					<ul>
						<li>WEB-INF
						<ul>
							<li>classes - any additional configuration if you'd like</li>
							<li>web.xml</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>webwork.jar</li>
		<li>launcher.jar</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<p>You can quickly get started by copying one of the existing webapps in the WebWork distribution.</p>

<p>Once you have it up and running, you are free to change your classes, JSPs, template files, and other files on the fly &#8211; all without compiling or redeploying. Some files, such as web.xml, will require that you restart QuickStart for the changes to take affect. Similarly, some frameworks, such as Hibernate, do not offer the full class-reloading support that WebWork does. Your mileage may vary, but we think no matter what you'll love developing in QuickStart.</p>

<h1><a name="QuickStart-HowItWorks">How It Works</a></h1>

<p>QuickStart works by using the combination of WebWork's "share nothing" (or rather, "share very little") architecture, an embedded Jetty server, some advanced class loading, and the Eclipse Java compiler (don't worry, the Eclipse IDE is not required!)</p>

<p>Running webwork.jar bootstraps the classpath and includes every jar found in the <b>lib</b> directory. It also includes webwork.jar, of course. It then invokes the QuickStart application. This, in turn, starts a Jetty server that is configured to the webapp specified in the <b>quickstart:xxx</b> argument. </p>

<p>The Jetty server's context ClassLoader is specified as a custom ClassLoader that looks at the source files in <b>webapps/xxx/src/java</b> and compiles them on the fly. These classes are also reloaded whenever a chance is detected.</p>

<p>Because WebWork creates a new action on every request, reloading the classes works great. You are free to change the entire class schema (methods, fields, inheritance, etc). Because none of the objects are cached or stored in long-term storage, you usually won't run in to any problems here.</p>

<h1><a name="QuickStart-RunninginYourIDE">Running in Your IDE</a></h1>

<p>Running QuickStart from your IDE is no different than running it from the command line. The only difference is that you need to set up the structure and classpath in your IDE properly. It doesn't really matter what is in the <b>classpath</b> as long the WebWork jar is included. Pay close attention to your <b>working directory</b>.</p>

<p>An example of what IntelliJ IDEA looks like when launching QuickStart from within the WebWork project is included for reference (click for a larger view):</p>

<p><a href='/download/attachments/5392/idea.png' target='idea.png' onClick='window.open("/download/attachments/5392/idea.png", "idea.png", "height=755,width=830,menubar=no,status=no,toolbar=no"); return false;'><img border='0' src='/download/thumbnails/5392/idea.png' width='200' height='181' align="absmiddle" border="0" ></a></p>

<h1><a name="QuickStart-CommonPitfalls">Common Pitfalls</a></h1>

<p>While WebWork is pretty good about making class reloading in QuickStart easy, other libraries and code are not. As a general rule of thumb, if any objects have long term state (singleton, session scope, etc), they will <em>not</em> be reloaded. The reloaded classes will <em>only</em> take affect after a new instance has been created with the <em>new</em> keyword or through reflection.</p>

<p>For example, Hibernate has been found to store references to the objects it persists for long periods of time because of it's caching mechanism. It also happens to hold a reference to the Class instance itself. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to allow you to change your models on the fly.</p>

You may even find yourself banging your head against the wall because some Foo instance can't be cast to the Foo class. This is the biggest challenge with using QuickStart and can best be mitigated by using libraries and code that share very little state.</td></tr></table></div></div>

<p>A final word of warning: QuickStart is not meant for production use, or even to be used as the sole environment for application development. Rather, it is meant to help you quickly develop proof-of-concepts see results quickly. We recommend you always at least test in other applications servers, such as Tomcat, Resin, or even standalone Jetty.</p>
