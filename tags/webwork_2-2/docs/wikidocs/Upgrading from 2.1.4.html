				    <p>Upgrading from 2.1.4 is pretty easy as no new libraries have been introduced. However, the TLD (taglib definition file) has been modified to support more JavaScript events, such as onBlur, onChange, etc. Be sure to check that you are using the latest TLD. This is automatic if you point web.xml to <b>/WEB-INF/webwork.jar</b>.</p>
