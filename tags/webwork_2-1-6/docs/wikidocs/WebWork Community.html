				    <p class="paragraph">WebWork&#039;s (WW) community is made up of users, developers, and bystanders. Each one is important in making Webwork a success. Users daily use the framework and provide valuable feedback on usuability, bugs, features, etc. Developers contribute their time writing a framework others may use. Bystanders look on watching the work unfold. Some of them will soon become users or developers.</p><h4 class="heading4"><a name="WebWorkCommunity-Whywedowhatwedo%3F"> Why we do what we do?</a></h4><p class="paragraph">This quote taken from <a href="http://opensource.org" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttp://opensource.org</a> best describes why we spend our time working for free.</p>&quot;The basic idea behind open source is very simple: When programmers can read, redistribute, and modify the source code for a piece of software, the software evolves. People improve it, people adapt it, people fix bugs. And this can happen at a speed that, if one is used to the slow pace of conventional software development, seems astonishing.&quot;<p class="paragraph">&quot;We in the open source community have learned that this rapid evolutionary process produces better software than the traditional closed model, in which only a very few programmers can see the source and everybody else must blindly use an opaque block of bits.&quot;</p><b class="strong"><a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/team.jsp" title="Visit page outside Confluence">Meet the team that contributes to Webwork and Open Symphony</a></b>
