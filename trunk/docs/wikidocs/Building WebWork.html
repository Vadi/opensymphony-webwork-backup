				    <h1><a name="BuildingWebWork-GettingtheSources">Getting the Sources</a></h1>

<h2><a name="BuildingWebWork-Distribution">Distribution</a></h2>
<p>The current distribution packages of webwork contain all sources, as well as all needed libraries for building jars and running. Distribution packages are found <a href="https://webwork.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=4007&amp;expandFolder=4007&amp;folderID=0" title="Visit page outside Confluence">here</a>.<br/>
The dependency resolution via Ivy is disabled by default for build from distribution package (&gt; Webwork 2.2 Beta 4). If you need to work with the Clover and Ivy related buildfile tasks, you might want to follow the instructions below.</p>

<h2><a name="BuildingWebWork-CVS">CVS</a></h2>
<p>The sources are are hosted via CVS on java.net. So getting your sources is quite standard:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you have not already done, login to repository:<br/>
<em>cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs login</em></li>
	<li>Checkout the the webwork sourcetree:<br/>
<em>cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs checkout webwork</em></li>
	<li>Checkout the the opensymphony common sourcetree:<br/>
<em>cvs -d :pserver:guest@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs checkout opensymphony/common</em></li>
</ol>


<p>If you are a registered user at Java.net, you might use your username instead of anonymous <em>guest</em> account.<br/>
For detailed information on how to setup different clients, visit <a href="https://webwork.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectSource" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttps://webwork.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectSource</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="BuildingWebWork-Building">Building</a></h1>

<p>We assume that you are familiar with ant as the standard build tool in the Java world.</p>

<h2><a name="BuildingWebWork-WhatisIvy%3F">What is Ivy?</a></h2>
<p>If you checked out the sources from CVS, you might have noticed that the lib directory is empty. Unfortunately this does not mean that webwork has no external dependecies at all. To be honest, as a full featured MVC framework it has lots of dependencies, which in turn means that there has to be some dependency management. This is where Ivy comes to play.<br/>
Ivy is a free java based dependency manager, with powerful features such as transitive dependencies, maven repository compatibility, continuous integration, html reports and many more. Ivy is fully integrated with ant, so you do not have to get into a complicated tool. See <a href="http://jayasoft.org/ivy" title="Visit page outside Confluence">&#104;ttp://jayasoft.org/ivy</a> for details.</p>

<h2><a name="BuildingWebWork-InstallingandusingIvy">Installing and using Ivy</a></h2>
<p>The installation is quite trivial: Put a copy of the ivy-1.x.jar found in the <em>common</em> directory of the opensymphony module in your <em>$ANT_HOME/lib</em> directory.<br/>
If you want to test the Ivy functionality, ensure you have an internet connection. Change into the webwork module directory and execute <em>ant init</em> (as you might guess, any other task depends on init). Ivy will now resolv all dependencies and (hopefully) download all required jars and put it into the <em>lib</em> directory.<br/>
See <a href="Dependencies.html" title="Dependencies">Dependencies</a> for informations on how to integrate Ivy in your own Webwork2 based projects.</p>

<p>Build now knows the property "skip.ivy". May be specified from build.properties file or from commandline ant execution with <em>-Dskip.ivy=true</em>. If set to true, dependency resolution via Ivy is omitted and build is done with current jars found in <em>lib</em> directory.<br/>
This behaviour is turned on by default for builds from the distribution package.</p></td></tr></table></div></div>

<h2><a name="BuildingWebWork-JUnitandClover">JUnit and Clover</a></h2>
<p>The full build process will require JUnit and Clover. <br/>
Place a copy of junit.jar (&gt;= 3.8.1) and clover.jar (&gt;= 1.3.9) into your <em>$ANT_HOME/lib</em> directory (if not already exists). If you haven't got these jars at hand, look into the <em>lib/build</em> directory of your webwork module after you called <em>ant init</em> in the step before...<br/>
Opensymphony Clover license is found in the <em>common</em> directory of the opensymphony module. Place the clover-license.jar into your <em>$ANT_HOME/lib</em> directory as well. Now you are ready to ...</p>

<h2><a name="BuildingWebWork-Build">Build</a></h2>
<p>Call <em>ant jar</em> or simply <em>ant</em> to build the webwork jars. Play around with other targets, as you like.</p>

<h2><a name="BuildingWebWork-JDK%2FJRECompatibility">JDK/JRE Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>Webwork requires JDK 1.4.2+ to build. JDK 5.0 is not required for building.<br/>
Webwork based applications require JRE 1.4.2+ to run. JRE 5.0 is not required to run unless your application uses the optional XWork-tiger module, which adds some Java 5.0 specific features to xwork functionality.</p>
