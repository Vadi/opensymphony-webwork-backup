				    <p>These are issues a developer using XWork 1.1 will need to know when migrating to XWork 1.2:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Configuration errors fail-fast - When XWork encounters errors loading xwork and validator configuration files, it will throw an exception rather than logging the error and continue processing.&nbsp; The goal is that errors are more apparent to the developer and not buried in a log file somewhere, but it does mean XWork is less tolerant.&nbsp; Please ensure all the appropriate files load correct and report any exceptions thrown that you feel shouldn't interrupt processing.</li>
