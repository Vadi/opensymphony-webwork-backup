				    <p>JSTL integration is built in to WebWork 2.2+ - there are no steps required to enable it. Simply refer to your JSTL expressions just as you would with a normal WebWork JSP tag, such as the property tag. This is accomplished a request wrapper called For more info, see the javadocs of the WebWorkRequestWrapper object:</p>

<p>All WebWork requests are wrapped with this class, which provides simple JSTL accessibility. This is because JSTL
works with request attributes, so this class delegates to the value stack except for a few cases where required to
prevent infinite loops. Namely, we don't let any attribute name with "#" in it delegate out to the value stack, as it
could potentially cause an infinite loop. For example, an infinite loop would take place if you called:
request.getAttribute("#attr.foo").</p>
