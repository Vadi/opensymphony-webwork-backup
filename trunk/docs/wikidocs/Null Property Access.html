				    <p class="paragraph">Null property access is a unique feature to WebWork that allows object graphs to be created at runtime, saving you the headache of having to pre-initialize them.</p><h3 class="heading3"> Simple object graphs</h3><p class="paragraph">The feature is quite simple: <b class="strong">only</b> during the ParametersInterceptor (when http parameters are applied to an action), if an expression being set, such as &quot;document.title&quot;, results in a NullPointerException, WebWork will attempt to create the null object and then try again. So in this case, if &quot;document&quot; is null, WebWork will construct a new Document object so that setting the title will succeed.</p>This is very useful because it reduces the amount of flattening (and unflattening) you are required to do in your action classes when displaying and setting data from web pages. Rahter, you can usually represent the complete object graph by just naming your input fields with well thought-out names (like &quot;document.title&quot;). <p class="paragraph"><h3 class="heading3"> Lists and Maps</h3></p>WebWork extends this feature even further by offering special support for Lists and Maps. If you are providing inpurt for one of these two interfaces, WebWork can be told what type of objects they will hold and automatically populate them accordingly. What this means is that if you refer to &quot;children[0].name&quot;, WebWork will automatically create a children List and also add an empty Child object to that list, so that setting a name on the expression &quot;children[0].name&quot; will correctly work. The same goes for maps.<p class="paragraph">For this to work you must tell the converters what the objects in the List or Map will be. You do this by specifying &quot;Collection_<a href="http://wiki.opensymphony.com//display/WW/property">property</a> = com.acme.CollectionItem&quot; in the conversion properties file. So if you have an action that has a children property that should be filled with Child objects, YourAction-conversion.properties should contain:</p><div class="code"><pre>Collection&#95;children = come.acme.Child</pre></div>
