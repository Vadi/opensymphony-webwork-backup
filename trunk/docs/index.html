WebWork is a Java web-application development framework. It is built specifically with developer productivity and
code simplicity in mind. WebWork is built on top of XWork, which provides a generic command pattern framework as well
as an Inversion of Control container. In addition to these features, WebWork provides robust support for building
reusable UI templates, such as form controls, UI themes, internationalization, dynamic form parameter mapping to JavaBeans,
robust client and server side validation, and much more.

Here you will find documentation and download information for the latest version of WebWork. Documentation for the
currently developing release can always be found on the WebWork wiki. If you have edits or corrections to make to
the documentation here, you may edit them directly on the wiki as well.
