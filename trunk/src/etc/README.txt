*** IMPORTANT ***

In this release (WebWork 2.2 beta 2), the documentation has *NOT* been updated.
In the docs directory you'll find the WebWork 2.1.7+ documentation. To find
the very latest 2.2 documentation, you'll need to go to the wiki, located at:

http://wiki.opensymphony.com/display/WW/Documentation

We will be adding documentation as quickly as possible for this release. Please
contribute to the documentation effort if you can.
