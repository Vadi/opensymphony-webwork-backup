*** IMPORTANT ***

The documentation found in the docs directory are a snapshot of the documentation
written to date. WebWork 2.2 is code complete and each new beta is simply additional
documentation. To find the very latest 2.2 documentation, you'll need to go to the
wiki, located at:

http://wiki.opensymphony.com/display/WW/Documentation

Please contribute to the documentation effort if you can.
