Custom Dojo Build profile : see /dojo.profile.js (in this project)

Currently, we use a patched version of WidgetManager 
to support widgets in packages other than dojo.webui.widgets
see dojo-widget-multiplePackages.patch

To re-build the __package__.js file here, you need to checkout dojo to parent of the webwork project folder

i.e.

projects/webwork
projects/dojo

Then run ant - unfortunately it seems to only work from the command line because of the BSF classes

ant djoj-profile

this calls the dojo buildscripts/build.xml release target passing some properties to specify our profile file, 
and to not compress the file - there seems to be errors when compressing.
