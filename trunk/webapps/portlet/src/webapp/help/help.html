<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>WWPortlet is a MVC Framework for JSR168 Portlet based on
    WebWork,Velocity, Spring, Hibernate. Using WWPortlet can minimize the
    difficulty of Portlet Development. During the Portlet development early
    stage, you even can use normal Web Container such as Tomcat, WAS as
    testing environment to develop portal application, and last deploy in
    the JetSpeed/Tomcat or WebSphere Portal Server v5.1.</P>

<P>Using WWPortlet to develop Portal Application, you do not need to
    know any API &amp; concept of Portlet &amp; JSR168, you can develop your
    Portal Application just as traditional WebWork/Velocity application.</P>

<H3>Why you need this MVC Portlet Framework?</H3>

<P>Recently more &amp; more developers are interesting in Portal
    Development, but JSR168 API is difficult to learn to develop big reality
    application. Also JSR168 API is different from traditional Servlet API,
    every client post request is seperated to two steps to run:
    processAction, (doView|doHelp|doEdit). Such development model is
    nightmare for newbie.</P>

<P>Now more open source fans are familiar in WebWork, Spring, Hibernate,
    Velocity etc. framework, and used those framework in their production
    successfully.</P>

<P class="infomark">Can we continue to use those skills in developing
    Portal application?</P>

<P class="infomark">Can we develop Portal application just as
    traditional J2EE application?</P>

<P class="donemark">The answer is yes, we do that. This is the right
    place to answer your those questions. You can use WWPortlet MVC
    Framework to develop portlet just like legacy WebWork/Velocity
    application, you can test your application in Tomcat/WebSphere, even in
    JSE, which WebWork provide such advantage. Then last deploy tested
    application in JetSpeed/WebSphere Portal Server as standard JSR168
    Portlet Application.</P>
