WebWork is a Java web-application development framework. It is built specifically with developer productivity and
code simplicity in mind. WebWork is built on top of XWork, which provides a generic command pattern framework as well
as an Inversion of Control container. In addition to these features, WebWork provides robust support for building
reusable UI templates, such as form controls, UI themes, internationalization, dynamic form parameter mapping to
JavaBeans, robust client and server side validation, and much more.
