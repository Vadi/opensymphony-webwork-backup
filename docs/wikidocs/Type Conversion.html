				    <p>WebWork has one of the most advanced type conversion abilities in any web-based framework in any Java language. Generally, you don't need to do anything to take advantage of it, other than name your HTML inputs (form elements and other GET/POST parameters) names that are valid <a href="OGNL.html" title="OGNL">OGNL</a> expressions.</p>

<h1><a name="TypeConversion-ASimpleExample"></a>A Simple Example</h1>


<p> Type conversion is great for situations where you need to turn a String in to a more complex object. Because the web
 is type-agnostic (everything is a string in HTTP), WebWork's type conversion features are very useful. For instance,
 if you were prompting a user to enter in coordinates in the form of a string (such as "3, 22"), you could have
 WebWork do the conversion both from String to Point and from Point to String.</p>

<p> <p/> Using this "point" example, if your action (or another compound object in which you are setting properties on)
 has a corresponding ClassName-conversion.properties file, WebWork will use the configured type converters for
 conversion to and from strings. So turning "3, 22" in to new Point(3, 22) is done by merely adding the following
 entry to <b>ClassName-conversion.properties</b> (Note that the PointConverter should impl the ognl.TypeConverter
 interface):</p>

<p> <p/><b>point = com.acme.PointConverter</b></p>

<p> <p/> Your type converter should be sure to check what class type it is being requested to convert. Because it is used
 for both to and from strings, you will need to split the conversion method in to two parts: one that turns Strings in
 to Points, and one that turns Points in to Strings.</p>

<p> <p/> After this is done, you can now reference your point (using &lt;ww:property value="post"/&gt; in JSP or ${point}
 in FreeMarker) and it will be printed as "3, 22" again. As such, if you submit this back to an action, it will be
 converted back to a Point once again.</p>

<p> <p/> In some situations you may wish to apply a type converter globally. This can be done by editing the file
 <b>xwork-conversion.properties</b> in the root of your class path (typically WEB-INF/classes) and providing a
 property in the form of the class name of the object you wish to convert on the left hand side and the class name of
 the type converter on the right hand side. For example, providing a type converter for all Point objects would mean
 adding the following entry:</p>

<p> <p/><b>com.acme.Point = com.acme.PointConverter</b></p>


<table cellpadding='5' width='85%' cellspacing='8px' class='noteMacro' border="0" align='center'><colgroup><col width='24'><col></colgroup><tr><td valign='top'><img src="icons/emoticons/warning.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"></td><td>
<p> Type conversion should not be used as a substitute for i18n. It is not recommended to use this feature to print out
 properly formatted dates. Rather, you should use the i18n features of WebWork (and consult the JavaDocs for JDK's
 MessageFormat object) to see how a properly formatted date should be displayed.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>WebWork ships with a helper base class that makes converting to and from Strings very easy. The class is <b>com.opensymphony.webwork.util.WebWorkTypeConverter</b>. This class makes it very easy for you to write type converters that handle converting objects to Strings as well as from Strings. From the JavaDocs for this class:</p>


<p> Base class for type converters used in WebWork. This class provides two abstract methods that are used to convert
 both to and from strings &#8211; the critical functionality that is core to WebWork's type coversion system.</p>

<p> <p/> Type converters do not have to use this class. It is merely a helper base class, although it is recommended that
 you use this class as it provides the common type conversion contract required for all web-based type conversion.</p>

<p> <p/> There's a hook (fall back method) called <code>performFallbackConversion</code> of which 
 could be used to perform some fallback conversion if <code>convertValue</code> method of this 
 failed. By default it just ask its super class (Ognl's DefaultTypeConverter) to do the conversion.</p>


<h2><a name="TypeConversion-BuiltinTypeConversionSupport"></a>Built in Type Conversion Support</h2>

<p><p/>
WebWork will automatically handle the most common type conversion for you. This includes support for converting to
and from Strings for each of the following:
<p/>
<ul>
<p/>
<li>String</li>
<p/>
<li>boolean / Boolean</li>
<p/>
<li>char / Character</li>
<p/>
<li>int / Integer, float / Float, long / Long, double / Double</li>
<p/>
<li>dates - uses the SHORT format for the Locale associated with the current request</li>
<p/>
<li>arrays - assuming the individual strings can be coverted to the individual items</li>
<p/>
<li>collections - if not object type can be determined, it is assumed to be a String and a new ArrayList is
created</li>
<p/>
</ul>
<p/>
<p/> Note that with arrays the type conversion will defer to the type of the array elements and try to convert each
item individually. As with any other type conversion, if the conversion can't be performed the standard type
conversion error reporting is used to indicate a problem occured while processing the type conversion.
<p/></p>

<h2><a name="TypeConversion-RelationshiptoParameterNames"></a>Relationship to Parameter Names</h2>

<p>The best way to take advantage of WebWork's type conversion is to utilize complete objects (ideally your domain objects directly), rather than submitting form values on to intermediate primitives and strings in your action and then converting those values to full objects in the execute() method. Some tips for achieving this are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use complex OGNL expressions - WebWork will automatically take care of creating the actual objects for you.</li>
	<li>Use JavaBeans! WebWork can only create objects for you if your objects obey the JavaBean specification and provide no-arg constructions, as well as getters and setters where appropriate.</li>
	<li>Remember that <em>person.name</em> will call <b>getPerson().setName()</b>, but if you are expecting WebWork to create the Person object for you, <b>a setPerson() must also exist</b>.</li>
	<li>For lists and maps, use index notation, such as <em>people[0].name</em> or <em>friends['patrick'].name</em>. Often these HTML form elements are being rendered inside a loop, so you can use the iterator tag's status attribute if you're using <a href="JSP Tags.html" title="JSP Tags">JSP Tags</a> or the ${foo_index} special property if you're using <a href="FreeMarker Tags.html" title="FreeMarker Tags">FreeMarker Tags</a>.</li>
	<li>FOr multiple select boxes, you obviously can't name each individual item using index notation. Instead, name your element simply <em>people.name</em> and WebWork will understand that it should create a new Person object for each selected item and set it's name accordingly.</li>
</ul>


<h1><a name="TypeConversion-AdvancedTypeConversion"></a>Advanced Type Conversion</h1>

<p>WebWork also has some very advanced, yet easy-to-use, type conversion features. Null property handling will automatically create objects where null references are found. Collection and map support provides intelligent null handling and type conversion for Java Collections. Type conversion error handling provides an easy way to distinguish the difference between an input validation problem from an input type conversion problem.</p>

<h2><a name="TypeConversion-NullPropertyHandling"></a>Null Property Handling</h2>


<p> Provided that the key #CREATE_NULL_OBJECTS is in the action context with a value of true (this key is set
 only during the execution of the com.opensymphony.xwork.interceptor.ParametersInterceptor), OGNL expressions
 that have caused a NullPointerException will be temporarily stopped for evaluation while the system automatically
 tries to solve the null references by automatically creating the object.</p>

<p> <p/> The following rules are used when handling null references:</p>

<p> <ul></p>

<p> <li>If the property is declared <i>exactly</i> as a Collection or List, then an ArrayList shall be
 returned and assigned to the null references.</li></p>

<p> <li>If the property is declared as a Map, then a HashMap will be returned and assigned to the null
 references.</li></p>

<p> <li>If the null property is a simple bean with a no-arg constructor, it will simply be created using the {@link
 ObjectFactory#buildBean(java.lang.Class, java.util.Map)} method.</li></p>

<p> </ul></p>


<p> For example, if a form element has a text field named <b>person.name</b> and the expression <i>person</i> evaluates
 to null, then this class will be invoked. Because the <i>person</i> expression evaluates to a <i>Person</i> class, a
 new Person is created and assigned to the null reference. Finally, the name is set on that object and the overall
 effect is that the system automatically created a Person object for you, set it by calling setPerson() and then
 finally called getPerson().setName() as you would typically expect.</p>


<h2><a name="TypeConversion-CollectionandMapSupport"></a>Collection and Map Support</h2>

<p>WebWork supports ways to determine the object type found in collections. This is done via an <em>ObjectTypeDeterminer</em>. The default implementation is provided. The JavaDocs explain how map and colelction support is determined in the DefaultObjectTypeDeterminer:</p>


<p> This ObjectTypeDeterminer looks at the <b>Class-conversion.properties</b> for entries that indicated what
 objects are contained within Maps and Collections. For Collections, such as Lists, the element is specified using the
 pattern <b>Element_xxx</b>, where xxx is the field name of the collection property in your action or object. For
 Maps, both the key and the value may be specified by using the pattern <b>Key_xxx</b> and <b>Element_xxx</b>,
 respectively.</p>

<p> <p/> From WebWork 2.1.x, the <b>Collection_xxx</b> format is still supported and honored, although it is deprecated
 and will be removed eventually.</p>


<p>Additionally, you can create your own custom ObjectTypeDeterminer by implementing the ObjectTypeDeterminer interface. There is also an optional ObjectTypeDeterminer that utilizes Java 5 generics. See the <a href="J2SE 5 Support.html" title="J2SE 5 Support">J2SE 5 Support</a> page for more information.</p>

<h3><a name="TypeConversion-Indexingacollectionbyapropertyofthatcollection"></a>Indexing a collection by a property of that collection</h3>

<p>It is also possible using webwork to get a unique element of a collection, by passing the value of a given property of that element. By default, the property of the element of the collection is determined in Class-conversion.properties using KeyProperty_xxx=yyy where xxx is the property of the bean 'Class' that returns the collection and yyy is the property of the collection element that we want to index on. Here is an example with the following two classes:</p>

<div class="code" style="border-style: solid; "><div class="codeHeader" style="border-bottom-style: solid; "><b>MyAction.java</b></div><div class="codeContent">
<pre class="code-java">/**
 * @<span class="code-keyword">return</span> a Collection of Foo objects
 */
<span class="code-keyword">public</span> Collection getFooCollection()
{
    <span class="code-keyword">return</span> foo;
}</pre>
</div></div>

<div class="code" style="border-style: solid; "><div class="codeHeader" style="border-bottom-style: solid; "><b>Foo.java</b></div><div class="codeContent">
<pre class="code-java">/**
 * @<span class="code-keyword">return</span> a unique identifier
 */
<span class="code-keyword">public</span> <span class="code-object">Long</span> getId()
{
    <span class="code-keyword">return</span> id;
}</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Then put <b>KeyProperty_fooCollection=id</b> in my MyAction-conversion.properties file. This would allow to the use of <b>fooCollection(someIdValue)</b> to get the Foo object with value <em>someIdValue</em> in the Set fooCollection. For example, <b>fooCollection(22)</b> would return the Foo object in the fooCollection collection whose id property value was 22.</p>

<p>This is useful, because it ties a collection element directly to its unique identifier and therefore does not force you to use an index and thus allows you to edit the elements of a collection associated to a bean without any additional code. For example, parameter name <b>fooCollection(22).name</b> and value <b>Phil</b> would set name the Foo object in the fooCollection collection whose id property value was 22 to be Phil. </p>

<p>Webwork automatically converts the type of the parameter sent in to the type of the key property using type conversion.</p>

<p>Unlike Map and List element properties, if fooCollection(22) does not exist it will not be created. To do that, use the notation <b>fooCollection.makeNew[index]</b> where index is an integer 0, 1, and so on. Thus, parameter value pairs <b>fooCollection.makeNew[0]=Phil</b> and <b>fooCollection.makeNew[1]=John</b> would add two new Foo objects to fooCollection one with name property value Phil and the other with name property value Bar. Note, however, that in the case of a Set, the equals and hashCode methods should be defined such that they don't only include the id property. That will cause one element of the null id propertied Foos to be removed from the Set.</p>

<h2><a name="TypeConversion-AnadvancedexampleforindexedListsandMaps"></a>An advanced example for indexed Lists and Maps</h2>

<p>Here is the model bean used within the list.<br/>
The KeyProperty for this bean is the id attribute.</p>

<p>The action has a beanList attribute initialized with an empty ArrayList.</p>

<p>These conversion.properties tell the TypeConverter to use MyBean instances as elements of the List.</p>

Notice the () notation! Do not use [] notation, this is for Maps only!<br/>
The value for name will be set to the MyBean instance with this special id.<br/>
The List does no longer have null values added for unavailable id values.<br/>
This avoids the risk of OutOfMemoryErrors!</p>

<h2><a name="TypeConversion-TypeConversionErrorHandling"></a>Type Conversion Error Handling</h2>


<p> Any error that occurs during type conversion may or may not wish to be reported. For example, reporting that the
 input "abc" could not be converted to a number might be important. On the other hand, reporting that an empty string,
 "", cannot be converted to a number might not be important - especially in a web environment where it is hard to
 distinguish between a user not entering a value vs. entering a blank value.</p>

<p> <p/> By default, all conversion errors are reported using the generic i18n key <b>xwork.default.invalid.fieldvalue</b>,
 which you can override (the default text is <i>Invalid field value for field "xxx"</i>, where xxx is the field name)
 in your global i18n resource bundle.</p>

<p> <p/>However, sometimes you may wish to override this message on a per-field basis. You can do this by adding an i18n
 key associated with just your action (Action.properties) using the pattern <b>invalid.fieldvalue.xxx</b>, where xxx
 is the field name.</p>

<p> <p/>It is important to know that none of these errors are actually reported directly. Rather, they are added to a map
 called <i>conversionErrors</i> in the ActionContext. There are several ways this map can then be accessed and the
 errors can be reported accordingly.</p>


<p>There are two ways the error reporting can occur:</p>

<ol>
	<li>globally, using the <a href="Conversion Error Interceptor.html" title="Conversion Error Interceptor">Conversion Error Interceptor</a></li>
	<li>on a per-field basis, using the <a href="conversion validator.html" title="conversion validator">conversion validator</a></li>
</ol>


<p>By default, the conversion interceptor is included in <a href="webwork-default.xml.html" title="webwork-default.xml">webwork\-default.xml</a> in the default stack, so if you  don't want conversion errors reporting globally, you'll need to change the interceptor stack and add additional validation rules.</p>
